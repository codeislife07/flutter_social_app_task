# 📱 InstaFeed – Social Media Feed App with Flutter

A clean, scalable Flutter application that mimics an Instagram-style feed with local storage, offline support, and modern UI/UX interactions.

> 🚀 Developed as part of a technical evaluation to showcase my practical knowledge of Flutter, Bloc pattern, local storage (SQLite), and Flutter best practices. This project demonstrates my ability to architect, manage state, and build visually appealing, responsive apps ready for production.

## 🧠 Architecture & Design

- **Bloc Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns with event → state flow
- **Feature-first Folder Structure**:
  - `auth/` → Authentication flow
  - `feed/` → Feed logic and UI
  - `widgets/` → Reusable UI components
- **Database Schema**:
  - `users (username)`
  - `posts (id, username, image_path, caption, timestamp, likes)`
  - `comments (id, post_id, username, text, timestamp)`
  - `liked_posts (post_id, username)`
